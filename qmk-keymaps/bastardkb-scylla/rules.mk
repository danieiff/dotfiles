# On first run, VIA copy the keymap from flash memory into EEPROM so that it can be rewritten by the VIA app. From this point QMK will use the keymap stored in EEPOM instead of flash.
# To clear EEPROM, Hold Bootmagic Lite key(usually Escape) while plugging the board in, which will also place the board into bootloader mode; then unplug and replug the board.
